How to Install EnBudget in Microsoft Windows
============================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: It isn't necessary to use the TAR GZIP package anymore. I added a ZIP package for Windows users.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After you download EnBudget you will need to unpackage it. Although the ".tar.gz" (a TAR file compressed using GZIP) is a common archive format used on Unix-like systems, Windows doesn't know what to do with it. Almost any third-party archival software will support it though. I recommend 7-Zip.

Python

Next, you will need to install Python. EnBudget was made using Python. Please download either the 32 bit or 64 bit version.

32 bit (x86): http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/python-2.7.1.msi

== or ==

64 bit (amd64): http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/python-2.7.1.amd64.msi

--------
wxPython
--------

Lastly, you will need to install wxPython. This was used to make the EnBudget user interface.

32 bit (x86): http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.11.0-py27.exe

== or ==

64 bit (amd64): http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-win64-unicode-2.8.11.0-py27.exe

-----------------
Starting EnBudget
-----------------

Double click the "enbudget.py" file. If Python is installed correctly then EnBudget will start.

If you don't want to see a command prompt window every time you run EnBudget (and you probably don't), then simply rename the file:

== from ==
enbudget.py
== to ==
enbudget.pyw

That's it!
